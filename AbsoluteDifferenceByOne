#Algorithm

In this problem the k value is given according to which we have to return the value which must be greater and equal to k also we have to iterate the number fromo right to left and we are checking the differnce between them each time we are using the loop to check is the number is according to the k vlaue like 2 digit or 3 digit then we check the differnce between the numbers is chcek is true then the function go main and add values in a new array and return it.

class Solution {
  public:
   bool check(int number) {
    int oldNum = number % 10;
    number /= 10;

    while (number > 0) {
        int newNum = number % 10;
        if (abs(oldNum - newNum) != 1) {
            return false;
        }
        oldNum = newNum;
        number /= 10;
    }
    return true;
}

    vector<int> getDigitDiff1AndLessK(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        // code here
        vector<int> result;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            if(arr[i]>9 && arr[i]<k && check(arr[i])){
                result.push_back(arr[i]);
            }
        }
        return result;
        
    }
};
